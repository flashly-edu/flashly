        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <span class="last-updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</span>

        <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Agreement”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you”, “your”) and Flashly (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Flashly”), the operator of the Flashly web application accessible at https://flashly-edu.github.io/flashly/ and any associated mobile-optimized interfaces, subdomains, APIs, and related services (collectively, the “Service” or “Platform”).</p>

        <p>By accessing, browsing, registering an account on, or otherwise using the Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, together with our <a href="../privacy/index.html" style="color:var(--primary);font-weight:500;text-decoration:underline;">Privacy Policy</a> (incorporated herein by reference), which forms an integral part of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>If you do not agree with any provision of these Terms, you must immediately cease all use of the Service.</p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>1. Scope of the Service</h2>

        <p>Flashly is an educational technology platform designed primarily to assist secondary and pre-university students — particularly those preparing for Singapore GCE O-Level, A-Level, and International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations — in creating, organizing, reviewing, and sharing digital flashcards and summary notes. Core functionality includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Spaced Repetition System (SRS) scheduling algorithms</li>
            <li>Community-shared public decks and curated study notes</li>
            <li>Personal study analytics, progress tracking, and XP-based gamification</li>
            <li>Private and collaborative deck editing (where enabled)</li>
            <li>Optional AI-assisted coaching features (subject to availability)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Service is provided free of charge in its current form. We reserve the right to introduce premium features, impose usage quotas, or transition to a partially or fully paid model in the future, subject to thirty (30) days’ notice where required by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

        <p>You must be at least thirteen (13) years of age to create an account and use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction (usually 18), you represent that you have obtained valid parental or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <p>Accounts registered using automated means, temporary / disposable email addresses, or for the primary purpose of circumventing restrictions are prohibited and may be terminated without notice.</p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts and Security</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Account Creation</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Account Accuracy</h3>
        <p>You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep such information up to date.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Multiple Accounts</h3>
        <p>Creating multiple accounts to gain unfair advantages in leaderboards, circumvent rate limits, evade bans, or for any other purpose deemed abusive is strictly prohibited.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use and Community Guidelines</h2>

        <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>Upload, share, or generate content that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, threatening, harassing, discriminatory, sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise objectionable;</li>
            <li>Infringe any intellectual property right, privacy right, publicity right, or other proprietary right of any third party;</li>
            <li>Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity;</li>
            <li>Engage in spamming, phishing, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any form of unauthorized advertising or solicitation;</li>
            <li>Introduce viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or any other harmful or technologically damaging material;</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage, disrupt, or disable any part of the Service, any server, or any network connected to the Service;</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Service;</li>
            <li>Use any robot, spider, scraper, crawler, or other automated means to access the Service for any purpose without our express written consent;</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the experience of other users;</li>
            <li>Use the Service for any commercial purpose other than as expressly permitted herein.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5. User-Generated Content – Ownership and License</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Ownership</h3>
        <p>You retain ownership of all flashcards, notes, tags, images, audio, and other content you create or upload (“User Content”).</p>

        <h3>5.2 License to Flashly</h3>
        <p>By uploading or creating User Content on the Platform, you grant Flashly a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify (solely for formatting, compression, or platform compatibility), display, distribute, and perform such User Content solely for the purpose of operating, improving, promoting, and providing the Service.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Public / Community Content</h3>
        <p>When you publish a deck or note as “public” or share it in any community section, you grant every user of the Service a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to view, study, copy (for personal use), and — where the deck settings permit — fork, edit, and redistribute derivative works under the same visibility settings.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>All right, title, and interest in and to the Service (excluding User Content), including but not limited to software, algorithms, designs, text, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio, video, interfaces, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and any other proprietary material are owned by Flashly or its licensors and protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

        <p>Nothing in these Terms grants you any right to use Flashly’s name, trademarks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features without prior written consent.</p>

        <h2>7. Termination and Account Suspension</h2>

        <p>We may suspend or terminate your account, access to all or part of the Service, or remove any User Content at any time, without prior notice, if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms, applicable law, or created a risk of harm to other users, the Platform, or Flashly.</p>

        <p>Upon termination, all licenses granted to you under these Terms immediately cease. Sections concerning intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, governing law, and dispute resolution survive termination.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>

        <p>We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, free of viruses or other harmful components, or that any errors will be corrected.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FLASHLY, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, USE, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS EXCEED THE GREATER OF (i) ONE HUNDRED SINGAPORE DOLLARS (S$100) OR (ii) THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU PAID US (IF ANY) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

        <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>

        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Flashly and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:</p>
