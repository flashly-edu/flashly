Add new features:
1. Study notes: in the current Decks tab, add a Notes button among the New Deck and New Subject button. When the new Notes is clicked, a new study note is created, the design in the decks tab should be similar yes distunguishable from the decks cards. When a study note is clicked, it will show a small container in the center of the screen (design like the deck header), with the  back button, except that in this container, there's this:
everything in deck-header-top-row same for note header top row, but below the note header, there's these cards: Create blank doc, Upload file.

Now when i create a blank doc, i expect to see this UI:
note-header-top-row only
rich text editor (Quill Rich Text Editor)

Edits are saved every 30 seconds (only if chnages have been made), or if the additioanl save button in the top row is clicked

now if users upload a pdf instead, the rich text editor is replaced by a sleak modern pdf ui. Make sure everything is saved efficiently to Supabase, no uploads exceeding certain sizes, good compression of uploads. 

Creating notes in groups should also be made possible. Ensure that both decks and notes that are personal, can be shared with a group too, so all group members can see.
